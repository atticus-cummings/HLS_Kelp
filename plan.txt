RF training classification:
- Create DEM mask 
- use Fmask to mask out clouds 
- Use Kmeans to differentiate ocean from kelp
- Create classification mask with:
    kelp = 0
    ocean = 1
    clouds = 2
    land = 3
Output combined file with  
    Bands B02, B03, 4, 5, 6, 7
    Classification mask 

RF prediction preprocessing:
- Create DEM mask
- Mask out clouds
    Clouds and land = [0]
export tif with:
    bands B02, B03, B04, B05, B06, B07 (land and clouds masked)

RF Classifier:
 - Open masked 4-band tif file
 - Run Classifier
 - Delete preprocessed image
 - Save image with:
    B02, B03, B04, B05
    Classification mask

MESMA density prediction
 - Open 5-band tif
 - Create dictionary of kelp pixel location to kelp pixel values
 - Create array 4-band*pixel #s of ocean end-members
    - Randomly select 30-ish
    - Dialate land mask first?

    Questions For Tom:

    How should I process from here?
        - Estimating kelp biomass
            Add up kelp pixel values?
    Processing process:
        - Dialating kelp mask slightly
        - Running mesma only on kelp vs whole image
        - Fixing error in RF
        - Case where ocean mask was too small 
    Is my mesma correct? What do each of the 30 layers represent?
